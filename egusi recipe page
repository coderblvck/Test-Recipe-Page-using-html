        <p>Egusi soup is a popular West African dish, particularly in Nigeria. Here's a basic recipe with ingredients:</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Egusi seeds: 1 cup (ground)</li> 
            <li>Vegetable oil: 1/2 cup</li> 
            <li>500g (chicken, beef, or goat meat, cut into bite-sized pieces)</li> 
            <li>1 or 2 medium-sized (cleaned and cut into steaks or fillets)</li> 
            <li>Vegetables: 2 cups (spinach, kale, or other leafy greens, chopped)</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 medium-sized (chopped or blended)</li> 
            <li>Pepper: To taste (habanero or Scotch bonnet, chopped or blended)</li> 
            <li>Stock or water: 4 cups</li> 
            <li>Seasoning cubes or powder: To taste</li> 
            <li>Salt: To taste</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Egusi paste: Blend the Egusi seeds with a little water to form a smooth paste.</li>

            <li>Cook the meat: In a pot, cook the meat with onions, seasoning cubes/powder, and salt until tender. Add water or stock as needed.</li>
            <li>Prepare the base: In a separate pot, heat the vegetable oil, add chopped onions, and saut√© until golden brown. Add chopped or blended tomatoes and peppers. Cook until the mixture thickens.</li>
            <li>Add the Egusi paste: Stir in the Egusi paste and cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>Combine with meat and fish: Add the cooked meat and fish to the Egusi mixture. If you're using palm oil, add it at this point for extra flavor and color.</li>
            <li>Add stock/water: Pour in the stock or water and allow the mixture to simmer for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add vegetables: Add the chopped vegetables (and pumpkin leaves if you're using them). Simmer until the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Adjust seasoning: Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or pepper if necessary.</li>
            <li>Optional: If you're using crayfish and periwinkle, add them at this point and allow the soup to simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve: Egusi soup is often served with pounded yam, fufu, or rice.</li>
